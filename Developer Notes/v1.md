# Version 1

We're going to start with the simplest implementation I can think of.

A blank UI with a chatbox (React), a single API call in the backend (FastAPI), and a database to store chat logs (SQLite).

Later, I'll want to incorporate Docker, add a file input to the UI (and give it some character), eventually switch to PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings or MongoDB depending on what my data looks like, and obviously work on the backend.
