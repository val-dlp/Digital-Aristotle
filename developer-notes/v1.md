We're going to start with the simplest implementation I can think of.

A blank UI with a chatbox (React), a single API call in the backend (FastAPI), and a database to store chat logs (SQLite). I'll be adding the documents I need to access into the repo (although not uploading them to Github obviously).

Later, I'll want to incorporate Docker, add a file input to the UI (and give it some character), eventually switch to PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings or MongoDB depending on what my data looks like, and obviously work on the backend.

## Project Needs

Although I want the system to help the user learn, the first priority is helping the user study. To do so, it has to fill the following processes.

1. Break down and classify input documents
2. Identify the most effecient path for covering all material
    1. Understand pre-requisites and order things correctly
        1. Populate the page with the listed topics for easy selection of tailored studying
    2. Identify connections between different topics and create a framework for asking questions that cover multiple topics at once
        1. Show breakdowns by topic on the page
    3. Create a framework for generating study plans based on a user's request and current background knowledge
3. Personalize material for the user
    1. Update study plan as the user completes study sessions
        1. Do this dynamically within a study session
    2. Create schedules for spaced repetition of learned concepts
    3. Alternate material and attempt to make it more engaging to promote user interest and longer/more consistent study sessions

## What is a study guide?

* The ideal topics, defined specifically and rigorously, to study given the length of the session, user interest, and user goals/benchmarks (all entered by user)
* A formulation of questions that fits the above
