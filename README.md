# Digital Aristotle

## Overview

It has always been a dream of mine to create software that helps people learn. While I've been doing that professionally with ApplyRight, I have to operate within certain constraints in the interest of making it a viable business.

Digital Aristotle - a vision of the future where everyone has an extremely knowledgeable personal tutor, is something I've been enamored with since 2012 when I encountered CGP Grey's wonderful video on the topic - although it wasn't until much later that I read Daniel Hillis' original essay on it. I don't believe either Grey nor Hillis could have anticipated the LLM explosion that happened post the release of ChatGPT, but I imagine that they, like I, are excited at the immense potential these programs have for changing the way we learn. AI is an existential threat to the current education system, but I believe that they have the power to build a much fairer, powerful, and more accepting system than has ever been possible.

I still have a lot to learn, but now that I'm looking for work and need to study up to be a good candidate, I figure it's as good a time as any to take a crack at this. After all, spending all of my time designing a program to help me study is surely more productive than reading textbooks and grinding leetcode.

## Structure

Development will focus on getting a minimally functioning version up fast and then adding improvements where needed. Major developments will be chronicled in developer notes.

## Setup

Create a .env file with relevant keys. Early versions of this project will use the OpenAI API for simplicity.

## Usage Policy

I'm doing this for fun and if any of it is useful to anyone, that'd make me super happy! But if you're going to re-use large portions of my code please ask for permission and refrain from doing so for commercial purposes.
